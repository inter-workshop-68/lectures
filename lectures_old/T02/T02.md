# What is a framework?

- A framework is a library that offers **opinions** about how software gets built.
- These opinions allow for **predictability** and **homogeneity** in an application.
  - Predictability allows software to scale to an enormous size and still be maintainable.
  - Predictability and maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of software.

# Vanilla JS or Framework?

- Vanilla JS
  - A less complex site, for example a personal to-do list or a site that displays mostly static content
- Framework
  - A large site with a complex UI. Frameworks provide solutions to common problems that would take an absurd amount of time and patience to implement with pure JavaScript.
